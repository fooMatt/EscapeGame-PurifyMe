# Escape Game Activity - PurifyMe
A proposed activity about bio-informatics and protein purification for an Escape Game for new qBio Masters students.<br>
The activity revolves around the purification of Huntingtin, the protein implicated in Huntington's Disease.<br>
This activity is intended to be played using a Linux terminal. All files necessary are in the folder `HEAD/`.<br>
Additional information is provided in the document **activite2-fiche.docx** which is intended to be provided in hardcopy for students to refer to while playing the game.<br>
***
In the first part, students will have to find 6 files hidden in a directory and move them to the same location as the principle code `PurifyMe.py`.<br>
In the second part, students will have to launch the `PurifyMe.py` script and learn about different chromatography techniques to purify proteins. Then they will choose 2 columns to purify Huntingtin based on the information provided by the programme and in the hardcopy document.<br>
***
To test this activity, download and unzip the `HEAD.tar.gz` folder. You may also download the **activite2-fiche.docx** file to see the instructions that students would be provided.
